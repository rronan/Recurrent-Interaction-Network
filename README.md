# Recurrent-Interaction-Network
Pytorch implementation of (Recurrent) Interaction Network


The code is divided in two modules:
- rin (Recurrent Interaction Network): learning to predict future trajectories of objects
- cnr (Compositional Neural Network): learning to reconstruct a segmentation mask given the position of objects in the scene
