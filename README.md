# Recurrent-Interaction-Network
Pytorch implementation of (Recurrent) Interaction Network


The code is divided in two modules:
- ```rin```: _Recurrent Interaction Network_ learning to predict future trajectories of objects
- ```cnr```: _Compositional Neural Network_ learning to reconstruct a segmentation mask given the position of objects in the scene 


```datasets/``` gathers datasets used for experiments.
